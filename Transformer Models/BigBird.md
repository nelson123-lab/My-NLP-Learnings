- BigBird is a transformer-based language model developed by Google in 2020. It is designed to handle long sequences of text, which is a common challenge in natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

- BigBird is unique in that it uses a sparse attention mechanism, which allows it to handle long sequences of text more efficiently than traditional transformer models. This is achieved by dividing 
  the input sequence into smaller segments and only attending to a subset of the segments at each layer of the model.

- One of the key features of BigBird is its ability to handle long sequences of text, which is important for tasks such as document classification and 
  language modeling. It has been shown to outperform traditional transformer models on these tasks, while also being more computationally efficient.

- BigBird has been used in a variety of NLP tasks, such as language modeling, question answering, and text classification. Its ability to handle long sequences 
  of text has been shown to improve the performance of these tasks compared to traditional models.
