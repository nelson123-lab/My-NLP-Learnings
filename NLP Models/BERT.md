BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, is a pre-trained language model developed by Google in 2018. It is a 
deep neural network architecture that is trained on large amounts of text data to learn the contextual meaning of words.

BERT is a bidirectional model, meaning that it takes into account the entire sentence when generating word embeddings. This allows it to capture the 
meaning of a word in different contexts, similar to ELMo. However, BERT uses a transformer architecture, which allows it to capture long-range dependencies 
between words more effectively than traditional recurrent neural networks.

One of the key features of BERT is its ability to perform well on a wide range of NLP tasks with minimal task-specific fine-tuning. This is because 
the pre-training process involves training the model on a variety of tasks, such as masked language modeling and next sentence prediction, which allows 
it to learn a general understanding of language.

BERT has been used in a variety of NLP tasks, such as question answering, sentiment analysis, and text classification. Its ability to generate high-quality 
word embeddings has been shown to improve the performance of these tasks compared to traditional models.
