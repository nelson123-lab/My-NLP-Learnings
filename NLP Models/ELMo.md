ELMo, which stands for Embeddings from Language Models, is a deep contextualized word representation model that has been widely used in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. It was developed by researchers at Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2) and University of Washington in 2018.

ELMo is a type of language model that is trained on large amounts of text data to learn the contextual meaning of words. Unlike traditional word embeddings, which represent each word as a fixed vector, ELMo generates dynamic word embeddings that capture the meaning of a word in different contexts. This is achieved by using a deep bidirectional language model that takes into account the entire sentence when generating word embeddings.

ELMo has been used in a variety of NLP tasks, such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and question answering. Its ability to capture the contextual meaning of words has been shown to improve the performance of these tasks compared to traditional word embeddings.
