OpenAI GPT-2 and GPT-3 are state-of-the-art language models developed by OpenAI. They are based on a transformer architecture similar to BERT, but are 
trained on a much larger corpus of text data.

GPT-2 was released in 2019 and was trained on a dataset of over 40GB of text data. It is capable of generating high-quality text in a variety of styles
and formats, such as news articles, poetry, and even computer code. GPT-2 has been used in a variety of applications, such as chatbots, language translation, and 
content generation.

GPT-3, released in 2020, is an even larger model, trained on a dataset of over 570GB of text data. It is currently the largest language model available, with 
175 billion parameters. GPT-3 has been shown to be capable of generating highly coherent and contextually relevant text, and has been used in a variety of 
applications, such as chatbots, language translation, and content generation.

One of the key features of GPT-2 and GPT-3 is their ability to generate text that is highly coherent and contextually relevant. This is achieved through 
the use of a transformer architecture that allows the model to capture long-range dependencies between words and phrases.
