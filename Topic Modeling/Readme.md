# Topic Modeling 

Topic Modelling provides us with mehtods to organize, understand, and summarize large collectiona of textual information. Some of the advantages includes:-

1. **Document Organization**: Topic modeling can be used to organize and categorize large collections of documents automatically. By identifying the underlying topics within the documents, it becomes easier to manage and navigate through them.

2. **Information Retrieval and Search**: It improves the efficiency of search engines by enabling users to find relevant documents or articles based on topics rather than just keywords. This is particularly useful when dealing with large volumes of unstructured text data.

3. **Content Recommendation**: Topic modeling can be used to recommend relevant content to users based on their interests or preferences. By understanding the topics present in the content they consume, personalized recommendations can be generated.

4. **Text Summarization**: It aids in summarizing large volumes of text by identifying the main topics discussed within the content. This can be useful in generating concise summaries or abstracts of documents.

5. **Understanding Trends and Patterns**: Topic modeling can help in identifying trends and patterns within a corpus of text data. By analyzing the distribution of topics over time or across different sources, insights can be gained into changing interests, emerging themes, or shifts in public opinion.

6. **Sentiment Analysis**: When combined with sentiment analysis techniques, topic modeling can provide deeper insights into the sentiment associated with specific topics or themes within the text data.

7. **Market Research and Customer Feedback Analysis**: It can be used to analyze customer feedback, reviews, and social media discussions to identify common topics or issues discussed by customers. This helps businesses in understanding customer preferences, concerns, and trends.

8. **Content Tagging and Annotation**: Topic modeling can be used to automatically tag or annotate documents with relevant topics, which facilitates better organization, retrieval, and analysis of the content.

# LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)
- LDA is a popular topic modeling technique to extract topics form a given corpus. LDA is a matrix factorization technique.
- LDA converts the document term matrix into lower dimensional matrices. M1 (Document topics matrix with N, K dimensions) and M2 (Topics with K,M dimesions.)
- We can use python library called pyLDAviz and gensim for doing topic modeling.
